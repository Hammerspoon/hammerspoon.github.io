# Note
 * There are two API changes in this release, both in hs.eventtap. See the *Extensions* section below for more information

## Core
 * *Added*: Preferences window now includes an option to disable sending crash reports, and a link to our privacy policy for crash reports. We would humbly request that you not disable the crash reports, as they are super helpful to us in improving Hammerspoon.
 * *Added*: Crash reports now include the location of C libraries loaded by Hammerspoon (we are trying to track down some crashes that make no sense and may be coming from stale on-disk libraries)

## Extensions
 * *Fixed*: hs.notify should no longer cause crashes
 * *Changed*: hs.eventtap.newKeyEvent() modifier table has changed. Values are now inspected, rather than keys.
 * *Changed*: hs.eventtap.keyStrokes() has been replaced with a different implementation that no longer accepts a modifiers table. The old implementation (which was always more suited to sending single key strokes) is still available, as hs.eventtap.keyStroke()
 * *Changed*: hs.pasteboard functions can now work with named pasteboards (useful for integrating with other automation tools)
 * *Added*: hs.drawing objects can now be filled with linear gradients
 * *Added*: hs.drawing.rectangle() objects can now be rounded rects
 * *Added*: hs.drawing.image() for rendering simple pictures on-screen (including animated GIFs)
 * *Added*: hs.usb for enumerating currently attached USB devices (in a future release, this will also be able to watch device insertions/removals)
