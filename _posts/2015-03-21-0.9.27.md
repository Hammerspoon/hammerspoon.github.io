# Note
 * The hs.spotify extension is reported to not be working with the latest Spotify client, due to changes in their AppleScript support. This will be addressed in a future Hammerspoon release (possibly by removing hs.spotify, if it is no longer workable)

## Core
 * *Changed*: Lua callbacks from C/ObjC extensions should now be unable to corrupt the Lua function registry if they are overfreed (which is a known bug in hs.notify)

## Extensions
 * *Changed*: hs.itunes and hs.spotify no longer display an hs.alert for each operation.
 * *Changed*: hs.window.windowsTo{East,West,North,South} now attempt to take window z-order into account when ordering windows by proximity
 * *Added*: hs.urlevent for reacting to hammerspoon:// URLs being opened by other apps (i.e. this is another way to do IPC with Hammerspoon)
