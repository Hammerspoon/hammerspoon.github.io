## Core

## Extensions
 * *Fixed*: Prevent a crash in hs.hotkey
 * *Fixed*: hs.hints will no longer flow window hint icons off the bottom of the screen
 * *Fixed*: Many extensions now have correctly formatted documentation. This is still a work in progress.
 * *Changed*: hs.uielemet now uses a more relaxed method of determining if an object is a window. This should help with unusual apps like Emacs.
 * *Added*: Added getCurrentArtist(), getCurrentAlbum() and getCurrentTrack() to hs.itunes and hs.spotify
 * *Added*: hs.window.focusWindowNorth/South/East/West() can now limit their search to windows from the same application
