# IMPORTANT
We are currently focusing very hard on a small set of very strange crashes in Hammerspoon.
If Hammerspoon crashes for you, *please* reach out to us via GitHub, or IRC, or email and send us your config.

At the moment we have extra Lua debugging enabled, which will trigger more crashes, but also produces better logs for us to fix the bugs. Apologies for the inconvenience this is causing, but it's making Hammerspoon better in the long run!

## Core

 * Our Lua bridge now pays more attention to memory management of the Lua stack, which should improve stability.

## Extensions

 * *Changed*: hs.processInfo now uses more robust memory management, and also now includes `buildTime` and `debugBuild` keys
 * *Changed*: hs.menubar:setClickCallback() now unconditionally removes existing callback handlers, fixing a potential leak
 * *Fixed*: hs.http should now manage memory more correctly
