## Core

  * Significant rearrangement of the Hammerspoon.app bundle. This should be transparent to users, but there may be some modules that are broken. Please open Issues on GitHub if this affects you.

## Extensions

  * Added: hs.shortcuts and a Shortcuts action for executing Lua in Hammerspoon
  * Added: hs.audiodevice:inUse() to identify if an audio device (input or output) is currently being used
  * Added: hs.camera for enumerating/watching camera devices, and checking the "in use" status
  * Fixed: hs.httpserver should now be able to process text WebSocket messages properly
  * Fixed: hs.http should no longer crash when its callbacks are called from a Lua corouting
  * Fixed: hs.expose should now handle screen layouts better
  * Changed: hs.canvas should now handle Lua garbage collection better
