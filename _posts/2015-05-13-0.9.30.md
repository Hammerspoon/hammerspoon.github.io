## Core
 * Crashlytics has been updated to the new Fabric framework, which Crashlytics is now part of. This should not affect users in any way
 * Fix various deficient extension credits, for extensions inherited from Hydra/Mjolnir

## Extensions
 * *Fixed*: hs.eventtap.event.keyStrokes() is now more efficient
 * *Fixed*: hs.drawing.newText() no longer crashes if its optional parameters are not passed
 * *Fixed*: Various extensions are now more careful with string parameters, which could previously cause crashes
 * *Fixed*: hs.grid no longer emits errors for unusual windows that have no value for :screen()
 * *Fixed*: hs.drawing methods can no longer cause crashes by being called against the wrong type of drawing object
 * *Fixed*: hs.menubar dynamic menus no longer cause Hammerspoon to crash if the menu generator callback returns the wrong datatype
 * *Fixed*: hs.uielement is now more robust in the face of errors when creating an object
 * *Fixed*: hs.eventtap.event no longer leaks one CGEventSourceRef per event
 * *Fixed*: hs.drawing no longer renders objects in the wrong place on non-primary displays
 * *Changed*: hs.event.keyStroke() no longer supports sending multiple keystrokes (see hs.event.keyStrokes() for that)
 * *Changed*: hs.hints.windowHints() now supports a callback function
 * *Added*: hs.http for making simple and complex HTTP requests
 * *Added*: hs.usb.watcher for reacting to USB device insertions/removals
 * *Added*: hs.drawing:setTextFont() for changing the font of a drawing object
