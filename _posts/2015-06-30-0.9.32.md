# WARNING WARNING WARNING
This release of Hammerspoon *may* break your existing config.

In particular, please pay attention to the following items:

 * Lua has been updated to 5.3.1, so some core Lua library functions may behave slightly differently, or no longer exist. See [the Lua website](http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/readme.html#changes) for the specific changes
 * Many hs.window API methods have changed their return type. They no longer report success/failure, but instead return the window object (allowing the calls to be chained)
 * hs.utf8_53 has been renamed to hs.utf8 and its API changed now that we no longer need to provide backports of Lua 5.3.x UTF8 functions

If you run into any problems, please reach out to us on GitHub or IRC!

## Core
 * Lua has been updated to 5.3.1
 * We now detect the use of older Mjolnir modules, and display a message suggesting the user update their config, iff they have had a crash
 * The text input field in the Console window will now grow/shrink vertically (use Option-Enter to add a line without submitting the Lua code, and Option-Arrows to navigate)
 * Lua header files are now included in the Hammerspoon.app bundle, if you need them to build extensions
