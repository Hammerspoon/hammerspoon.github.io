# Important note

We have noticed that some users are experiencing crashes with Hammerspoon. This should never happen! If you are seeing any crashes, please either reach out to us on github, or in IRC, or email cmsj@tenshu.net. We really want to figure out why these crashes are happening, and get them fixed!

## Core

## Extensions
 * *Fixed*: hs.hotkey should be less likely to crash in confusing edge cases
 * *Changed*: Added hs.window.toggleZoom(), which mirrors the behaviour of the OS X window zoom button (pre Yosemite)
 * *Changed*: Added hs.crash.isMainThread() to aid debugging odd callback related crashes
 * *Changed*: hs.alert() is now callable, to reduce repetition
