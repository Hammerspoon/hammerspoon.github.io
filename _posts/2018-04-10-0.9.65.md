# IMPORTANT
We are currently focusing very hard on a small set of very strange crashes in Hammerspoon.
If Hammerspoon crashes for you, *please* reach out to us via GitHub, or IRC, or email and send us your config.

At the moment we have extra Lua debugging enabled, which will trigger more crashes, but also produces better logs for us to fix the bugs. Apologies for the inconvenience this is causing, but it's making Hammerspoon better in the long run!

## Core

 * Code paths from Hammerspoon into Lua code should be generally more reliable now
 * Extra protection was added to all extensions that use callbacks. This may trigger more crashes in the short term, but allows us to fix the issues more easily.
 * Console window tab completion no longer leaks a Lua stack slot

## Extensions

 * *Fixed*: hs.location callbacks should now receive the correct arguments as documented
 * *Fixed*: hs.notify no longer leaks a Lua stack slot in some circumstances
