# IMPORTANT
We are currently focusing very hard on a small set of very strange crashes in Hammerspoon.
If Hammerspoon crashes for you, *please* reach out to us via GitHub, or IRC, or email and send us your config. We have not yet been able to reproduce the crashes, and are very keen to do so!

## Core
 * *Changed*: Crash message logging has now been fixed
 * *Fixed*: Console window should now format dates consistently regardless of user locale
 * *Fixed*: Console window reload toolbar icon now scales properly
 * *Fixed*: Various issues found by code analysis and memory analysis (including at least two crasher bugs)

## Extensions

 * *Added*: hs.hid.capslock
 * *Added*: hs.tangent
