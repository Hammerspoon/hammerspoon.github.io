## Core

  * Hammerspoon's Lua environments now pass in a high quality random number to `math.randomseed()` so it is no longer to manually call that function in your Lua configs
  * For new users, Hammerspoon now defaults to running without a dock icon

## Extensions

  * Fixed: hs.itunes extension now correctly talks to macOS 10.15's Music.app
  * Fixed: various bugs in hs.uielement
  * Added: hs.screen:setOrigin()
  * Added: hs.math with a couple of random number generation functions
  * Added: hs.window.timeout()
  * Added: hs.plist.readString()
  * Changed: hs.image.imageFromURL() now supports asynchronous operation via a callback
