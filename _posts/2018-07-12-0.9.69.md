Minimum OS X version: 10.10

0.9.67 was a decent sized release, but since we've had to immediately do two brownbag releases to fix crash bugs, you might not see the release notes for 0.9.67.
They're worth reading, so you can find them [here](http://www.hammerspoon.org/releasenotes/0.9.67.html)

## Core

 * None

## Extensions

  *Fixed*: revert another memory leak fix which can also cause crashes
