# IMPORTANT
We are currently focusing very hard on a small set of very strange crashes in Hammerspoon.
If Hammerspoon crashes for you, *please* reach out to us via GitHub, or IRC, or email and send us your config. We have not yet been able to reproduce the crashes, and are very keen to do so!

## Core

 * *Changed*: Lua's internal API checker is now enabled. This may well cause more crashes than before, but if you report them to us, we can fix them and Hammerspoon will be more reliable!
 * *Changed*: The main Hammerspoon preferences window is no longer opened every time the user runs a new version of Hammerspoon.

## Extensions

 * *Changed*: hs.midi's underlying MIDI library has been updated.
 * *Changed*: hs.alert now supports fading in and out
 * *Changed*: hs.osascript.appleScriptFromFile() and hs.osascript.javascriptFromFile() now ignore shebang lines at the start of script files
 * *Changed*: hs.keycodes should now only list selectable layouts and input methods
 * *Changed*: hs.tangent now correctly handles multiple commands arriving concurrently from a tangent device
 * *Fixed*: hs.streamdeck's discovery callback is now correctly invoked when a streamdeck device is disconnected
