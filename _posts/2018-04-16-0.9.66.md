# IMPORTANT
We are currently focusing very hard on a small set of very strange crashes in Hammerspoon.
If Hammerspoon crashes for you, *please* reach out to us via GitHub, or IRC, or email and send us your config.

At the moment we have extra Lua debugging enabled, which will trigger more crashes, but also produces better logs for us to fix the bugs. Apologies for the inconvenience this is causing, but it's making Hammerspoon better in the long run!

## Core

 * None

## Extensions

 * *Fixed*: hs.menubar no longer crashes if a menu item triggers a refresh of the menu data
