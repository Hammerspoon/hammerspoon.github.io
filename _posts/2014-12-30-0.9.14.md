## Core
 * *Added*: Crashlytics crash handling framework. This is active, but not currently very useful, as extension libraries are not symbolicated.

## Extensions
 * *Changed*: hs.application.applicationForPid changed to hs.application.applicationForPID
 * *Changed*: hs.hints now offers an optional "vimperator" style. Window hints now use two letters, the first of which is taken from the name of the application.
 * *Added*: hs.uielement low level extension for working with UI elements. This is unlikely to be directly useful to many users, but offers powerful primitives for higher level abstractions
