<h1>About</h1>
Hammerspoon is an advanced automation tool for OS X. At its heart, it is a bridge between the operating system and a Lua scripting engine.

You can quickly achieve powerful automation just by writing Lua scripts, and if you need access to something Hammerspoon doesn't currently expose, you can write an extension.
