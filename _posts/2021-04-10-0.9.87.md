Minimum macOS version: 10.12

## Core

  * The additional compiler protections from 0.9.86 have been disabled. This version should therefore be safe to upgrade to, if you use the `hs` command line tool.
  * The website documentation now contains links to the source code of each function/method/etc.

## Extensions

  * Fixed: hs.json no longer returns a string instead of a table in some situations
  * Fixed: hs.webview:evaluateJavaScript() callbacks can no longer sometimes run on a background thread (which would crash Hammerspoon)
  * Fixed: hs.task should no longer crash Hammerspoon when a SIGPIPE is raised
  * Added: hs.audiodevice.defaultEffectDevice() and hs.audiodevice:setDefaultEffectDevice()
