## Core
 * *Fixed*: Lua exceptions raised by code in the Hammerspoon Console should no longer cause the whole app to abort()

## Extensions
 * *Fixed*: Prospective fixes for crash bugs in hs.application.watcher, hs.eventtap.event and hs.application
 * *Fixed*: hs.drawing objects are now correctly garbage collected across configuration reloads
 * *Changed*: hs.itunes and hs.spotify return nil on errors in their getFoo() functions, instead of a table of Applescript error information
 * *Added*: hs.screen.setShadows()
 * *Added*: hs.screen.getGamma(), hs.screen.setGamma() and hs.screen.restoreGamma() for inspecting/manipulating the white and black points of monitor gamma curves
 * *Removed*: hs.screen.setTint(), which was impossibly unfriendly to use, almost entirely undocumented, and is superceded by the preceeding fooGamma() function/methods
