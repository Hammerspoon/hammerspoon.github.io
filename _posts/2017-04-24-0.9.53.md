Minimum OS X version: 10.10

## Core
 * Addeed support for pure-Lua plugins, or _Spoons_, see [http://www.hammerspoon.org/Spoons/](http://www.hammerspoon.org/Spoons/)
 * The bundled Lua is now 5.3.4
 * Exceptions generated inside Hammerspoon as part of Lua callbacks are no longer fatal and will print a traceback to the Console window
 * Crash report uploading behaviour can now be controlled via hs.uploadCrashData()
 * Hammerspoon now exposes a minimal AppleScript API for executing Lua code from AppleScript
 * The console window will now save/restore its window location

## Extensions

 * *Fixed*: Guarded against a potential crash in hs.application:getMenuStructure()
 * *Fixed*: hs.application.find() no longer fails if applications have no :name() value
 * *Fixed*: hs.checkForUpdates() can now optionally check for Hammerspoon updates without presenting any UI if an update is found
 * *Fixed*: Removed a small memory leak in hs.menubar when removing menu items
 * *Fixed*: hs.host.cpuUsage now properly samples CPU ticks
 * *Fixed*: hs.chooser will now scroll to values selected via hs.chooser:selectedRow()

 * *Fixed*: hs.application:path() now correctly distinguishes between multiple installed copies of the same application
 * *Changed*: hs.keycodes.map now includes modifier keycodes, JIS keycodes, and will fallback to ANSI US keyboard values

 * *Changed*: hs.color objects can now be created from HTML hex colour strings
 * *Changed*: hs.noises now uses its own processing queue, which should make Hammerspoon more responsive when this module is being used
 * *Changed*: hs.httpserver, hs.doc.hsdocs and hs.httpserver.hsminweb can now be configured to listen on a specific network interface
 * *Changed*: hs.keycode.map.kVK\_ANSI\_Quote now contains the correct value

 * *Added*: hs.pasteboard.readAllData(), hs.pasteboard.writeAllData()
