      <code>hs.wifi.watcher.new(fn) -> watcher</code>
      <p>Creates a new ssid-watcher that can be started; fn will be called when your ssid changes</p>

<p>Note that fn will be called both when you join and leave a network. You can identify which<br>
type of event is happening, with hs.wifi.currentNetwork(), which will return nil if you<br>
have just left a network (and note further that switching from one network to another will<br>
therefore trigger two calls to fn, one when leaving the current network and one when joining<br>
the new one).</p>

<p>You would be advised to retain a variable somewhere with the &quot;last associated network&quot;, thus<br>
allowing you to determine which network has been left, if that is something you wish to react<br>
to.</p>

      <h3><a href="#start">start</a></h3>
      <code>hs.wifi.watcher:start() -> watcher</code>
      <p>Starts the ssid watcher, making it so fn is called each time the ssid changes</p>

    <section id="stop">
      <a name="//apple_ref/cpp/Function/stop" class="dashAnchor"></a>
      <h3><a href="#stop">stop</a></h3>
      <code>hs.wifi.watcher:stop() -> watcher</code>
      <p>Stops the ssid watcher&#39;s fn from getting called until started again.</p>
