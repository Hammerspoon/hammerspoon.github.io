# IMPORTANT
We are currently focusing very hard on a small set of very strange crashes in Hammerspoon.
If Hammerspoon crashes for you, *please* reach out to us via GitHub, or IRC, or email and send us your config. We have not yet been able to reproduce the crashes, and are very keen to do so!

## Core
 * *Changed*: Crash message logging has now been fixed

## Extensions

 * *Changed*: hs.socket can now be used for binary protocols
