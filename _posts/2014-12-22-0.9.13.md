Minimum OS X version: 10.8

## Core
 * *Added*: Community Code of Conduct, taken from http://contributor-covenant.org/

## Extensions
 * *Added*: hs.menubar for creating and managing arbitrary menubar icons (and associated dropdown menus)
 * *Added*: hs.hints for switching window focus with transient application hotkeys, displayed in pretty onscreen icons
 * *Changed*: hs.window:toggleFullscreen() is now hs.window:toggleFullScreen() to be more consistent. Sorry for the API change!
 * *Changed*: hs.window now supports :moveToScreen() and :ensureIsInScreenBounds()
 * *Changed*: Added hs.application.watcher to allow callbacks for various application lifecycle events
 * *Changed*: hs.hotkey.modal can now accept nil parameters to allow a modal state to exist without a top-level hotkey, and be controlled entirely programatically
